## Welcome to CSI-3471 Group Project

### Project Title: Bear Trade Platform

### Project Vision:
The Bear trade platform will provide the users the platform to sell the good(textbook, furniture, etc) and post the need for the community. 
Selling can either be achieved by placing the bid or regular selling posts. There should be various payment methods supported(cash,
PayPal, google pay, apple pay, etc). Sellers and buyers can evaluate each other after the trade, and the evaluation will be counted towards credit. Users' profiles can be viewed by other users in the community.
