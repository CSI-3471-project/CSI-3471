  <h2 id="welcome-to-the-bear-trade-platform-project-page">Welcome to the Bear Trade Platform Project Page</h2>
  <p>The Bear trade platform will provide the users the platform to sell the good(textbook, furniture, etc) and post the need for the community. 
      Selling can either be achieved by placing the bid or regular selling posts. There should be various payment methods supported(cash,
      PayPal, google pay, apple pay, etc). Sellers and buyers can evaluate each other after the trade, and the evaluation will be counted towards credit. Users' profiles can be viewed by other users in the community.</p>
  <p>This site is where we collaborate to share updates, host files, and provide information for the status of our
                game as it is in development and beyond. Code and relevant files can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/CSI-3471-project/CSI-3471.git">here</p>
    or downloaded directly <a href="https://github.com/CSI-3471-project/CSI-3471/archive/master.zip" download></p>
